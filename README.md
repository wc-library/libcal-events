# libcal-events
Small project to retrieve LibCal events from their API and embed them into a website. 


## Installation

1. You'll need an Apache server with PHP for the index.php file to live. 
2. You'll need to configure Apache to `access-control-allow-origin` for the server you plan to embed your Events into.
3. Edit both the `.html` file and the `.php` file to enter the necessary variables for your specific configuration (API Key, base URLs, etc.)
4. You'll need to copy the contents of the `.html` file into a page on your site where you intend to display the Events.
